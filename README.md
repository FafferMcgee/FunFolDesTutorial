## Scenarios: Examples of use

The most simple example, the insertion of a __single motif__ segment into a template __without binder__ can be found [here](scenarios/nobinder/onesegment).

To find a example that fits a particular type of problem, you can follow this table:


||__binder__|__nobinder__|
|-|-|-|
|__one segment__|[bo](scenarios/binder/onesegment)|[no](scenarios/nobinder/onesegment)|
|__multiple segment__|[bm](scenarios/binder/multisegment)|[nm](scenarios/nobinder/multisegment)|

Different scenarios can be presented in each example type.
