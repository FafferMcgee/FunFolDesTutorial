# AS 4OYD


## Question: Can we fold 4OYD with and without binder to be itself?

In this scenario, we use __4OYD__ as template, as the source of our motif and binder and as the final target conformation we are aiming to mimic.

We will run the protocol with and without a binder. Using full CA constraints from the template.

### Nomenclature:

* __Template:__ Structure that will accomodate the query motif.  
* __Design:__ Chain that we are designing; contains the query motif and is guided by the template info.  
* __Binder:__ If any, is whatever protein(s) bind to the query motif.  
* __Target:__ Protein that we expect our design to resemble to and to which we compare.
