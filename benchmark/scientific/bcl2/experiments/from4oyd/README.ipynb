    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we use __3LHP__ as template, and __4OYD__ as the source of our motif and binder and as the final target conformation we are aiming to mimic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run the protocol with and without a binder. Using full CA constraints from the template (_fullcst_) or just constraints between residues belonging to the same secondary structure (_ssecst_).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first have a *no_design* run that entails only the __NubInitioMover__. This runs will generate poses that have to be considered as non-final, and, thus, should not be considered on their own without further processing.\n",

    "* __Template:__ Structure that will accomodate the query motif.  \n",
    "* __Design:__ Chain that we are designing; contains the query motif and is guided by the template info.  \n",
    "* __Binder:__ If any, is whatever protein(s) bind to the query motif.  \n",
    "* __Target:__ Protein that we expect our design to resemble to and to which we compare.  "
